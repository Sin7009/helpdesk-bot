## 2024-05-22 - [Active Ticket UX Block]
**Learning:** Users who encounter blocking states (like "You already have a ticket") need guidance on *what to do* next, not just an error message. Simply blocking them feels like a dead end. Providing the context (Ticket ID) and the action ("Just write here") transforms a frustration into a helpful nudge.
**Action:** When implementing blocking checks, always include the "Now What?" instruction in the feedback message.
